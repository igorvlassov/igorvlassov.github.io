<body lang="ru-RU" link="#000080" vlink="#800000" dir="ltr"><p>Ichimoku
cloud indicator or Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is a versatile “all-in-one”
technical analysis indicator incorporating multiple elements
represented by different indicators. It was created and first
published by the Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in 1969.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the Ichimoku indicator provides signals for which
you would otherwise apply more indicators at the same time. It is
structured in a way to give you information about trend direction,
support and resistance levels as well as momentum.</p>
<p>Since the indicator includes multiple information, the Ichimoku
chart gives you an insight into the price features through different
data points. Hence, when you see the Ichimoku indicator plotted on
the chart, it can look confusing or messy because of the multiple
lines and areas shown. Nevertheless, understanding the indicator is
not as hard as it looks, as long as you know what each element of the
Ichimoku indicator represents.</p>
<p>The Ichimoku chart consists of five different lines providing an
overview of the price action and two of these lines form a shaded
area called the Ichimoku cloud. Accordingly, if you want to grasp the
main notion behind the Ichimoku cloud indicator, you should get into
the meaning of each line as well as the role of the lines in the
Ichimoku setting.</p>
<h2 class="western">Ichimoku cloud explained: indicator lines</h2>
<p>Each Ichimoku indicator component (indicator) represents a certain
aspect of the price action and is calculated accordingly. An example
of the elements on a trading platform is presented in the next graph.</p>
<p><img src="ichimoku_html_df5b6b666d180ff8.png" name="Image1" align="bottom" style='width:98%;' border="0"/>
</p>
<p>You can see that there are five lines on the chart along with the
coloured area, which represents the cloud. Each of the lines is
calculated in a certain way and signifies specific aspects of the
indicator. The lines are as follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Conversion line (Tenkan-Sen) –
	can be perceived as the short-term line and it represents the
	average of the high and the low for the 9-period (9-period high +
	9-period low / 2).</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Base line (Kijun-sen) – is
	the long-term line and it is calculated as the average of the high
	and low for the 26-period (26-period high + 26-period low / 2).</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Lagging Span (Chickou Span) –
	is a lagging line which represents the closing price for the
	previous 26 periods. This line enables you to easily compare the
	current price movements with the movements from 26 periods ago.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Leading span A (Senkou Span A
	)– is used as a leading indicator defined for future 26 periods.
	The values for this indicator are obtained as the middle point of
	Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen based on the past last 26 periods
	(Conversion Line + Base Line) / 2)</p>
	<li><p>The Leading Span B (Senkou Span B) – also used as a leading
	indicator since it is calculated for 26 periods ahead and it is
	based on the average of the 52 periods high and 52 periods low
	(52-period high – 52-period low / 2).</p>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Ichimoku cloud</strong>&nbsp;(Kumo) is one of the
most notable features presented on the chart, and it is the area
between the Leading Span A and the Leading Span B lines. Reading the
cloud is not as complicated as it may seem. You will locate a
possible signal by determining where the price is located compared to
the Ichimoku cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">If the price is located above the
	Ichimoku cloud, then a positive trend is expected</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">You can expect a negative trend if
	the price falls below the cloud</p>
	<li><p>A price level located within the cloud is an indication of a
	flat trend</p>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes in the cloud colour occur based on the movement of the
leading span line. For instance, if leading Span A crosses above the
Leading Span B, the area will be green (the colour used for the cloud
can be different depending on the trading platform). The periods
stated are the default periods for this indicator. Of course, you can
always change this set-up in the indicator settings and adjust them
according to your trading strategy.</p>
<h2 class="western">How can you use the Ichimoku cloud indicator?</h2>
<p>The Ichimoku trading strategy can offer alerts for potential buy
and sell signals since it is able to identify potential trend
direction and momentum. The Ichimoku indicator can be beneficial if
you want to define stop-loss points, which can be at the support
level. Also, the Ichimoku cloud is used by traders because it
provides a certain estimation about the future price level. In
general, the Ichimoku cloud indicator can be used in your trading
strategy for the following.</p>
<p><strong>Determine trend direction</strong>&nbsp;– one way to
find the trend direction is through the Conversion and Base lines
signals. When the Conversion line goes above the Base line, a
positive trend is anticipated. The opposite or negative trend is
expected when the Base line goes above the Conversion line (shorter
period line).</p>
<p><strong>Support and resistance levels</strong>&nbsp;– are
identified by the leading span A and B lines, which serve as the
edges of the Ichimoku cloud. Since the Ichimoku cloud indicator
provides price prediction, the cloud edges additionally provide an
overview of the current and future support and resistance levels.</p>
<p><strong>Determine crossovers</strong>&nbsp;– you look for
crossovers between the Conversion line and the Base line. Remember
that you should pay attention to the location of the crossover so you
can determine its strength. Depending on the type of crossover and
whether it is located below, inside or above the cloud, the signal
can be weak, neutral or strong.</p>
<p><strong>Ichimoku cloud</strong>&nbsp;– it can be bullish or
bearish. Look at the Leading Span A and Leading Span B or, more
precisely, the position of these lines at the graphic and the cloud.
Indication for possible bullish trend appears when the Leading Span A
increases above the Leading Span B line (bullish Kumo). A bearish
trend can be identified when the Leading Span A decreases or falls
below the Leading Span B (bearish cloud). A trend reversal can be
evident when Leading Span A and B change their positions. You can
determine the strength of the trend by looking at the angle of the
Ichimoku cloud, where a steep upward or downward angle indicates a
strong trend.</p>
<h2 class="western">Ichimoku signals</h2>
<p>The type of signal depends on the element we look at. There are
various signals on the Ichimoku chart...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Conversion/Base line cross</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Cloud breakout</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Leading Span A and B cross;</p>
	<li><p>Lagging Span cross</p>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using this indicator means that you are familiar with the
different buy and sell Ichimoku signals, which can appear on your
chart as well as other signals. Therefore, the Ichimoku strategy can
be created around the Ichimoku signals:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Bullish trend – the price is
	above the cloud</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Bearish trend – the price is
	below the cloud</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Ranging trend – the price is in
	the cloud</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Buy signal - Conversion line
	crosses above the Base line and both lines along with the price
	being above the cloud</p>
	<li><p>Sell signal – appears if the Conversion line crosses below
	the Base line while the price and both lines are found under the
	cloud</p>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Ichimoku cloud signals examples</h2>
<p>Let's look at another graph where we can identify some of the
signals originating from this indicator.</p>
<p><img src="ichimoku_html_954f2b08bd29404f.png" name="Image2" align="bottom" style='width:98%;' border="0"/>
	<br><br>
You
can see two of the potential types of signals. On the left side of
the middle of the graph, there is a conversion/Base line cross above
the Ichimoku cloud. On the right side, you can see that the Leading
Span A and B cross were signaling a negative movement.</p>
