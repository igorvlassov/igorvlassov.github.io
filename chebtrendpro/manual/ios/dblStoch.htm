Easy isn't it? <br>
<br><b>But how we can make backtest optimization?</b><br><br>
The goal of backtest optimization is to find top and bottom line values for highest profit.<br>
We assumend that we have unlimited credit and we can buy 100 papers at any buy signal.<br>
So open position can include more than 100 stocks but we can sell of course only if position opens.<br>
At the end we have a couple of trades and their result:<br><br>

Good Trading!
