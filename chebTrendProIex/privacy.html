            <p>"So far, your program is proving to be very accurate. I have never encountered Fourier software with predictive indicators.
I like the concept".<br>
- David </p>

<p>"I trade forex and I use a few indicators to help me and a few websites. All my info was telling me last night that the GBP/JPY was in a SELL trend for the next 24 hours but your app was telling me to BUY. So going against it I placed a SELL and this morning when I woke up I checked the trade and to my surprise it was losing big time. If I had gone with what Fourier Predictor was telling me I would've won easily. I learned my lesson."<br>
