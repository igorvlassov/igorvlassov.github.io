User can add new group by pressing <b>+</b> button or delete group by pressing <b>-</b> button.<br>
User can enter into existing group by pressing one of Groups buttons.<br>
Inside group user gets access to symbols (i.e. indicies, currency pairs, other financial instruments).<br>
He can add new FOREX pairs or symbols by search in Yahoo Finance or Google Finance listed symbols:<br><br>
<img border="0" src="add_symbol.png"><br><br>
Yahoo and Google driven suggest systems allow to search not only by symbol's name but by it's description substring also.<br>
Yahoo listed symbol can be added directly without selection in suggest form.<br>
Time frames available for symbols depend of data feed source:<br><br>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Yahoo</th><th>Google</th><th>FXCM</th><th>Other FOREX</th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="yahooTF1.png"></td><td><img src="googleTF1.png"></td><td><img src="fxcmTF1.png"></td><td><img src="forexTF1.png"></td></tr>
</table>
By pressing <img border="0" src="zip.png"> button user starts data retrieving & recent signals' counting against the current group.<br>
After process completion up or down arrows should appear left to symbols depending on signal's direction.<br>
<a href = #ssignal>Supersignal</a> users: if last signal is <a href = #ssignal>supersignal</a> arrow is replaced by double arrow.<br>
Pressing on some symbol in Symbols panel opens <b>Charts</b> panel:<br><br>
<img border="0" src="scan_yahooTF.png"><br><br>
Red and green triangles show signal direction.<br> 
Warning: depending of Chebyshev Trend curve's dynamic nature signals can disappear or change their direction when new data is arrived.<br>
User can return to former signals on daily, weekly and monthly data feeds by last data changing at right top of the app.<br><br>
<b>Bottom toolbar</b><br><br>
Indicators' combo box allows to add to chart one of classic indicators: MA - upto 6 various MA lines; BB - Bollinger bands; SAR; FBB - <a href="http://www.marketvolume.com/technicalanalysis/bollingerfibonacci.asp">Fibonacci Bollinger Bands</a>; Price Channel; AD. Check <a href = #appendix1>Appendix #1</a> for the full current indicators'/oscillatrs' list.<br><br>

Oscillators' combo box allows to add to chart one of the following oscillators: MACD, Volume+Chaikin, BB%B, Slow Stochastic, RSI, CCI, ADX, MFI, StdDev, StochF, EliotWaves, QQE, WilliamsR. Check <a href = #appendix1>Appendix #1</a> for the full current indicators'/oscillatrs' list.<br><br>

<b>Chebyshev Trend indicator parameters description:</b><br><br>
Chebyshev trend line is polynom of some order (2 for stright line and more), it's created using a modified Gaussian least squares fit on
certain amount of data (60-200 in the app). The higher polynom order lead to more accurate polynom line.
Lower polynom order lead to more common trend line, 2 for simple line trend for ex.
Amount of data = time frame taken in account in calculation. The longer it, the more past datas used for polynom calculation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Some trading ideas</b><br><br>
As I said earlier Chebyshev trend line is polynom of some order, it's created using a modified Gaussian least squares fit on certain amount
of data. It's counted & redrawn when new data is available to fit best. So trend line data can be changed in the past &
signals are re-counted too.<br>
I think, it's not fully correct to generate signals based on the trend line, it's mostly for trend visualisation. But many people asked me
about signals & I made it. <br>
I think, there are 2 methods of trade could be:<br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Signal was in the past & trend line shows almost constant direction. You can open trade & set stop near opposite s/r line.</li>
<li>Signal is now. You can try to open trade &  set initial stop-loss as close as possible to signal and ajust it if trend really moves
according to signal.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<a name = ssignal><b>SuperSignal is developed at last!</b></a>
<br><br>
A lot of us searched how to improve the app signals quality but most succesfull inventor is Alon Hadar!<br>
And there is a method description as he explains it:<br>
the key is to use only the signals that are paralleled to price touching lower order channels<br>
in the direction of the channels trend only<br>
long = channels are up + price near channel's bottom + chebyshev signal buy<br>
short = channels are heading down + price near channel's upper line + chebychev signal sell<br><br>
<img border="0" src="supersignal.png"><br><br>
Put attantion that there are 2 variables for the channel that can change ther results - the most important is the polynom order - default is 4 
but in some cases the 3/5/6 show better results. The trader should "play" with the channel order to find the channel 
that is most reliable meaning that price touch the bands and reverse as much as possible.<br>
The second variable is the standard deviation which default is 2 like bollinger
but in some cases when the security is very volatile you can increase the s.d. to get better results.<br>
<br>The last tip is:<br>
Traders should trade only the signals that are in the direction of the last signal in the higher frame meaning - <br>
 if in weekly frame last signal is long they should take all long signals on daily frame and avoid all short signals;<br>
 if in weekly frame last signal is short they should take all short signals on daily frame and avoid all long signals.<br><br>

Also Marcello Djunaidy offers to use Supersignal as an envelope for overbought/oversold indication: buy when below envelope, sell when above envelope<br>

<b>About BB%B oscillator:</b><br>
Thanks TayJT who offered to implement it. He provided the formula as it was developed by Tradestation members:<br>
BB%B = 100 * ( Price - LowerBand ) / ( UpperBand - LowerBand ) ; <br>
Ken Burkhalter modified it to scale chart from 100/0/-100:<br> 
BB%B = 100 * ((Price-LowBand) - (HighBand - LowBand)/2) / ((HighBand-LowBand)/2);
This would more clearly show the deviation of a price from mean value.<br>
