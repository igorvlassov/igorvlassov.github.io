        <p class="lead"> Nowadays, when so many different things are necessary for life, it is easy to take out a lot of loans from different banks. Also you can get a bunch of credit cards and successfully use them. And there is also a mortgage, payments for communication and Internet, utilities. Everything needs to be paid on time, and it is not clear how much money will be left to last until the next paycheck.<br> 
Sound familiar? Then this app is for you! It will help keep your finances under control. Just enter your main expected incomes and expenses and keep track of the amount you can count on. Is the payment deadline approaching? The app will notify you on the day specified.

            <p>"So far, your program is proving to be very accurate. I have never encountered Fourier software with predictive indicators.
I like the concept".<br>
- David </p>

<p>"I trade forex and I use a few indicators to help me and a few websites. All my info was telling me last night that the GBP/JPY was in a SELL trend for the next 24 hours but your app was telling me to BUY. So going against it I placed a SELL and this morning when I woke up I checked the trade and to my surprise it was losing big time. If I had gone with what Fourier Predictor was telling me I would've won easily. I learned my lesson."<br>
